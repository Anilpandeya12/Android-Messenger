And vice versa. Used Java Socket API. All communication over TCP. Assumed that the size of a message will never exceed 128 bytes (characters).\r\n\r\nIn the app, we can open only one server socket that listens on port 10000 regardless of which AVD your app runs on.\r\n\r\nThe app on avd0 can connect to the listening server socket of the app on avd1 by connecting to <ip>:<port> == 10.0.2.2:11112.\r\n\r\nThe app on avd1 can connect to the listening server socket of the app on avd0 by connecting to <ip>:<port> == 10.0.2.2:11108.\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n[1] More project details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JqBqZChFWzbnTXgbYB8Z6l9IRlzt8c0loIwa6ymkPps/pub)\r\n\r\n[2] Single best resource on Android, [Android dev](http://developer.android.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nProduct demo:\r\n\r\n\r\n![Emulator-1](https://raw.github.com/adilansari/Android-Messenger/master/screen/Emulator-1.png)\r\n\r\n![Emulator-2](https://raw.github.com/adilansari/Android-Messenger/master/screen/Emulator-2.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
